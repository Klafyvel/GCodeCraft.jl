# GCodes

[![Build Status](https://github.com/klafyvel/GCodes.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/klafyvel/GCodes.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This is an abstraction layer for GCode manipulation in Julia. It is inspired by [Jack Minardi's mecode](https://github.com/jminardi/mecode).

There use to be a [GCode.jl package by Steve Kelly](https://github.com/sjkelly/Gcode.jl), but it hasn't been updated in 9 years and cannot work withcurrent versions of Julia.
